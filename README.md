# LinkPredictionVGAE

This work is part of my Master's program in Artificial Intelligence at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1. It focuses on graph-based link prediction using a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE). The notebook demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of a VGAE model applied to a dataset of airports, their coordinates, and population data.

## Setup

### Run on Google Colab

1. Upload the following files to your Google Colab session:
   - `LinkPredictionVGAE.ipynb`
   - `airportsAndCoordAndPop.graphml`

2. Execute the cells in Colab to test the results.
